# My Cyber Journey
Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio. I'm documenting my hands-on projects, learning milestones, and areas of specialization. 
This portfolio includes work on SOC operations, GRC, vulnerability analysis, and more.

I’ve completed:
- IBM Cybersecurity Analyst Certificate ⭐
- Full-time Cybersecurity Bootcamp at Lighthouse Labs ⭐
- Hands-on labs and guided paths through TryHackMe ⭐
- Currently focused on GRC, IAM, Zero Trust, and cloud security ⭐

My goal is to blend strategy with clear communication to help organizations manage risk, respond to incidents, and build resilient systems. I’m especially interested in roles related to governance, compliance, threat detection, and incident response.

This portfolio highlights:
- My cybersecurity journey and key learning milestones
- Projects, labs, policies, and documentation I’ve worked on
- Reflections, resources, and things I’m still exploring
